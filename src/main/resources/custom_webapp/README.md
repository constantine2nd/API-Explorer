# custom_webapp folder


## Introduction

This folder will contain the customer's front end files, it can not be tracked in the github. So the default is empty.

If you set the props `use_custom_webapp=true`, that means you will use your own design of the frontend web page.

Then you **MUST** copy all the files from the folder `OBP-API/obp-api/src/main/webapp` to here, and customize the HTML, CSS,
or JS files as your requirements.
